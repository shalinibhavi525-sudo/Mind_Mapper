Mood vs Memory Visualizer
MindMapper helps students explore how their mood influences study retention.
You log your topic, mood, and recall level; the app then visualizes mood-memory
correlations with an interactive chart.

- See an interactive Chart.js graph of mood vs memory
- Simple insight text (“You remember best when calm ■”)
- Offline via localStorage
## ■ Tech Stack
HTML 5 · CSS 3 · JavaScript (Chart.js)
## ■ Why This Matters
> MindMapper shows how small self-tracking tools can bridge psychology and
> data visualization. It turns introspection into evidence.
